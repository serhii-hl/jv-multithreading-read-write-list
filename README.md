# Read-write list

Implement methods in `ReadWriteList` class so that multiple threads could read data at the same time
as long as thereâ€™s no thread that is updating the data. Only one thread can update the data at a time
causing other threads (both readers and writers) to block until the update is over.

Use `ReadWriteLock` implementation for this purpose. 

In your solution you should lock and unlock `read` and `write locks` in order to fulfill 
the conditions above.
Remember to use `try-finally` construct - you want to release the lock 
even if the operation with the underlying `list` was not successful.

You can run `main()` to check your solution
